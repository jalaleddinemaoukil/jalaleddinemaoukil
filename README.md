I'm a Software Engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset. Over the past three years, I have combined technical expertise with business acumen, delivering solutions that not only work beautifully but also drive revenue and growth.

Current ventures:

Running a freelance design & development business, delivering conversion-optimized websites.
Architecting cloud-native solutions on Azure for real-world IoT applications, Mentoring teams on modern web development and best practices.

## Entrepreneurial Philosophy

I don’t just create features; I develop **profitable products**. Every technical decision I make takes into account:
- User experience and conversion optimization
- Scalability for business growth
- Maintainability for long-term ROI
- Market fit and client satisfaction

Whether it's a freelance project or an enterprise solution, I approach development with an owner's mindset.
