## Entrepreneurial Philosophy

I don't just build features—I build **profitable products**. Every technical decision considers:
- User experience and conversion optimization
- Scalability for business growth
- Maintainability for long-term ROI
- Market fit and client satisfaction

Whether it's a freelance project or an enterprise solution, I approach development with an owner's mindset.
